  "aboutText": "Welcome to our planetary app, featuring Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Ceres (a dwarf planet) and Moon.\nA traditional Earth-style calendar doesn't quite work on some planets. For example, a year on Mercury is nearly half an Earth Day, while on Venus, a year spans almost two Earth days.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, planets like Uranus and Neptune take extraordinarily long to orbit the sun—about 116.87 and 244.09 Earth years respectively. The same applies to Saturn and Pluto. For practical and human-scale use, these durations are simply too vast, so we’ve chosen to exclude those planets from our calendar.\n\nFor the included planets, we’ve created a unique calendar system inspired by Earth’s familiar format. Here's how the months and days look:\n\nJanuary: Earth – 31, Mars – 57, Jupiter – 891\nFebruary: Earth – 28, Mars – 52, Jupiter – 806\nMarch: Earth – 31, Mars – 57, Jupiter – 891\nApril: Earth – 30, Mars – 54, Jupiter – 864\nMay: Earth – 31, Mars – 57, Jupiter – 891\nJune: Earth – 30, Mars – 54, Jupiter – 864\nJuly: Earth – 31, Mars – 57, Jupiter – 891\nAugust: Earth – 31, Mars – 57, Jupiter – 891\nSeptember: Earth – 30, Mars – 54, Jupiter – 864\nOctober: Earth – 31, Mars – 57, Jupiter – 891\nNovember: Earth – 30, Mars – 54, Jupiter – 864\nDecember: Earth – 31, Mars – 57, Jupiter – 891\n\nPlanetary Day Lengths (in Earth Days):\nEarth: 1 day\nMars: 1.03 Earth days\nJupiter: 0.4 Earth days\n\nAll our planetary calendars begin from a unified starting point: 01.01.0000.\n\nSpecial thanks to NASA for planetary data: Planetary Fact Sheet – Metric\n\nEnjoy exploring time across the cosmos with our app!",
